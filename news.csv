"Good morning. Earlier this month, Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot reported that the government was rethinking arguably the most unpopular policy introduced by Labour since the election: the cut to winter fuel payments for pensioners. Nonsense, No 10 sources insisted in the following days: “There isn’t a review and I’d be amazed if we changed anything.” No 10 sources are now, presumably, amazed, because yesterday Keir Starmer announced exactly what had been so strenuously denied: a plan to loosen eligibility requirements so that more pensioners qualify, to be introduced at the autumn budget. This isn’t a complete U-turn: fewer pensioners will receive the payment than before Rachel Reeves’s decision of 2024. But it is a very significant step. Many Labour MPs – to say nothing of the pensioners who lost out – will be wondering why the government went ahead with such a painful policy in the first place for such minimal economic gain. But even if the criticisms have been painful, Starmer insists that the change is possible because of a brightening economic outlook. Against that optimistic gloss is the argument that Labour is acting because it knows the policy was a colossal misjudgement. Today’s newsletter explains how the change came about, and what it means in practice. Here are the headlines. Five big stories US news | A suspect is in custody after shooting dead two Israeli embassy staff, said to be a couple about to become engaged, outside a Jewish museum in Washington. The suspect yelled “Free, free Palestine” after he was arrested, police said. Prisons and probation | Justice secretary Shabana Mahmood is considering mandatory chemical castration for the most serious sex offenders, according to government sources. The option is part of a package of “radical” measures to ease prison overcrowding included in an independent sentencing review. Trump administration | Donald Trump ambushed the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, by playing him a video that he falsely claimed proved genocide was being committed against white people under “the opposite of apartheid”. The stunt set up the most tense Oval Office encounter since Trump’s encounter with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February. West Bank | Israeli troops fired “warning shots” towards a group of 25 diplomats visiting Jenin in the Israel-occupied West Bank on Wednesday. The delegation included representatives from Italy, Canada, Egypt, Jordan, the UK, China and Russia. UK politics | Reform UK has pledged to remove all low-traffic neighbourhoods from the council areas it controls – but all 10 local authorities say they do not actually have any in place. In depth: The totem that turned into an albatross – and then a reverse ferret The winter fuel payment is worth about £200 a year to pensioners under 80, and £300 for those who are older. When the government changed the rules last year, restricting eligibility to individuals with income below £11,800 or couples with income below £18,023, about 10 million people lost the payment. That included a million families in the poorest fifth of UK households, and 70% of pensioners with disabilities. The saving was estimated at £1.4bn a year. When Labour lost two-thirds of the council seats it was defending in the local elections this month, many in the party said the decision was one of the issues that came up most persistently with voters. Discussions were already under way about a change, Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot reported – but the electoral damage brought the issue into sharp focus. Now, after weeks of denial and evasion, Keir Starmer has finally acted. *** How the denials disappeared On the day the initial story was published, Labour’s denials were forthright. A government spokesperson told reporters that there “will not be a change to the government’s policy”; the health and social care secretary, Wes Streeting, insisted the threshold was not being reviewed, and that the measure was necessary “in order to deliver the change that people voted for”. Two Downing Street sources told HuffPost UK no review was under way. But by last weekend a different picture was emerging. The Sunday Times reported that the government was running focus groups on how voters would respond to possible changes, and quoted a No 10 source saying the issue was “more under discussion”. And in the following days, the language from ministers changed. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said that the policy “stands” but refused to deny that a change was possible. Then Rachel Reeves said that she understood “the concerns that some people have about the level at which the winter fuel payment is removed” and added: “We’re always listening to these things.” On Tuesday, the BBC reported that a change was under consideration. Finally, Keir Starmer said at PMQs yesterday: “I recognise that people are still feeling the pressure of the cost of living crisis, including pensioners … and that is why we want to ensure that … more pensioners are eligible for winter fuel payment.” In this piece, Kiran Stacey sets out more detail on how the shift happened. “Some officials now say they felt they had to deny the reports until a decision was made in order to protect the chancellor’s authority,” he writes. “Others suggest that while there had been political discussions, the policy machine had not yet got up and running, and the denials softened once it was.” *** The economic backdrop Starmer has said the decision was possible because the economy is improving. He has some evidence to support his case: figures released earlier this week showed the UK economy growing by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year – slightly more than forecast and the highest rate in the G7. Recent deals with India, the US and the EU have further bolstered the government’s confidence, and tax revenues have also grown this year. But while the growth figures are relatively good news, they are not likely to be maintained: one of the key reasons for that is the ensuing arrival of Donald Trump’s tariffs, which were not a factor when the original cut was made. The deal with the EU is important, but it is only estimated to be worth about a 0.3% uptick in GDP by 2040. And in any case, the amount that will be spent on the changes to the winter fuel payment threshold is too small for a change in the economic outlook to be a serious factor. All of that suggests that this was, primarily, a political decision. *** What the change means in practice While Starmer’s announcement was significant, it was also short on detail. The government has not yet said how many of those who lost the payment will have it restored, or how eligibility will be measured. Officials fear that simply increasing the pension credit threshold to which it is currently linked will increase take-up of that benefit, thereby wiping out any potential savings, Pippa Crerar reported. The Resolution Foundation said that making those with incomes 20% above the pension credit threshold eligible would cost about £100m and make the payment available to 400,000 additional families. Nor is the announcement likely to have a rapid impact. It is a preview of a future decision, not a policy change today – and if done at the autumn budget it is not expected to come into force until winter 2026. *** The political fallout Kemi Badenoch and the Conservative-supporting media, unsurprisingly, sought to present the decision as a climbdown that indicates the government’s incompetence. Yesterday, Badenoch said the change was a “desperate” move and said that inflation has doubled since Starmer took office. (She also said that while the Tories would restore the payment to everyone earning up to £15,000, she wouldn’t raise taxes to pay for it, which is a useful reminder of the luxuries of opposition.) Labour MPs, on the other hand, welcomed the measure – not really as a political victory, but as a damage limitation exercise that will blunt attacks from other parties, and an answer for constituents who feel that the government has betrayed them. Expect to hear a lot of the framing that it is Labour’s sound economic management that has made the change possible, however dubious that claim may be. The decision is likely to only be a preview of some of the rough waters ahead for Starmer over government cuts. Next month, MPs will vote on separate cuts to disability benefits – as part of a welfare reform bill that an impact assessment estimated would result in an extra 250,000 people – 50,000 of them children – in relative poverty by the end of the decade. On Tuesday, the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, insisted the changes were necessary to save the welfare state from collapse. But more than 100 Labour MPs have said they are not prepared to support the bill. This measure is in part intended to appease those would-be rebels – and ministers are expected to announce a child poverty package of up to £750m to win them over, too. In the meantime, even if Starmer’s announcement furnishes ministers with a more plausible answer to critical questions over the cost of living, there is little prospect of making the problem go away.

Anzorov, who was shot dead at the scene by police, killed Paty after messages spread on social media that the teacher had shown his class cartoons of the prophet Muhammad from the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Seven men and one woman appeared in Paris’s special criminal court on Monday. They included friends of Anzorov who are accused of helping purchase weapons for the attack, as well as people who are accused of spreading false information online about the teacher and his class, contributing to a climate of hatred before the attack. Brahim Chnina, a 52-year-old Moroccan man who worked in transport for people with disabilities, appeared in court after spending four years in jail on remand. He is the father of a schoolgirl in Paty’s class who was aged 13 at the time of the attack and is central to the case. She claimed Paty had asked Muslim students to identify themselves and leave his classroom before showing caricatures of the prophet Muhammad. The claim was false and she later told investigators she was not in the classroom that day. Chnina’s daughter was last year convicted for making false allegations and given an 18-month suspended prison sentence in a trial held behind closed doors in the juvenile court, without the media present. Chnina and another defendant, Abdelhakim Sefrioui, are accused of launching an online campaign against Paty. According to the prosecution, the two men spread the daughter’s lies on social networks with the aim of “designating a target”, “provoking a feeling of hatred” and “thus preparing several crimes”. They are being tried for participation in a criminal terrorist act, a crime punishable by 30 years in jail. Paty is now regarded as a hero of free speech by the French authorities and his school is being renamed after him. He had made references to Charlie Hebdo magazine and cartoons of the prophet as part of an ethics class to discuss free speech laws in France, which included a class debate. Paty told students beforehand that they were not obliged to look at the cartoons if they did not want to. Weeks before the class, Charlie Hebdo had republished the cartoons, having first published them in 2012. In 2015, radicalised gunmen stormed its Paris office, killing 11 people inside and a police officer outside, in coordinated terrorist attacks that also resulted in a second police officer being killed and four hostages murdered at a kosher supermarket. Two young friends of Anzorov appeared in court on charges of “complicity in terrorist murder”, a crime punishable by life imprisonment. Naim Boudaoud, 22, and Azim Epsirkhanov, 23, a Russian of Chechen origin, are accused of having accompanied Anzorov to a knife shop in the northern city of Rouen the day before the attack. Their lawyers have denied they had any “complicity” in the crime. Five other teenagers, who were aged between 14 and 15 at the time, were found guilty of criminal conspiracy with intent to cause violence in a trial at the juvenile court last year. They were found guilty of having helped point out Paty to Anzorov when he asked who the teacher was. They said they never thought it would lead to his murder. Four were given suspended sentences. The trial, heard by a panel of judges, runs until 20 December.",The Guardian,Eight go on trial over beheading of teacher Samuel Paty in Paris,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/04/eight-on-trial-in-paris-beheading-teacher-samuel-paty,2024-11-04T11:51:15Z

"Pope Francis has urged people not to be drawn towards “pessimism and resignation” despite wars and social injustices throughout the world, but to retain a “gentle gaze of hope”. The head of the Catholic church gave the Thought for the Day on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday, wishing listeners “peace, fellowship and gratitude” for the new year and emphasising the importance of humility. In the message, Francis said: “Hope and kindness touch the very heart of the gospel and show us the path to follow in our behaviour. A world full of hope and kindness is a more beautiful world. A society that looks to the future with confidence and treats people with respect and empathy is more humane.” Focusing on the theme of hope, he said: “Even though we do not know what tomorrow may hold for us, we should not look to the future with pessimism and resignation. Wars, social injustices, and the many forms of violence we are exposed to every day should not dishearten us nor draw us towards scepticism and discouragement. “We choose love and love makes our hearts fervent and hopeful. Those who love, even if they find themselves in uncertain situations, always view the world with a gentle gaze of hope.” Francis said kindness was “not a diplomatic strategy” but instead represented a “form of love that opens hearts to acceptance, and helps us all to become more humble”. He added: “How important humility is. Humility lends itself to dialogue, helps to overcome misunderstandings and generates gratitude.” Quoting from the autobiography of British writer GK Chesterton, the pope invited people to “take the elements of life with gratitude and not for granted”. Francis recently began celebrations for the church’s holy year jubilee, a centuries-old tradition that now occurs every 25 years and will involves tens of millions of pilgrims heading to Rome. “I hope that during this jubilee we can practise kindness as a form of love to connect with others,” he said. “May the new year bring us peace, fellowship and gratitude.” The Argentina-born Francis, 88, was invited to deliver a message by the Today programme’s guest editor, Prof Irene Tracey, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford. The regular segment welcomes people from all the major faiths to share reflections on the world. Francis recorded his message in Italian before it was translated into English for UK radio audiences. It is the second time Francis has appeared on the Thought for the Day segment, having first spoken in October 2021 before the Cop 26 climate summit.",The Guardian,"Don’t give in to pessimism despite wars and injustice, says Pope Francis",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/28/dont-give-in-to-pessimism-says-pope-francis-in-bbc-thought-for-the-day,2024-12-28T09:46:25Z

"Jack Geerlings crouches down at the shoreline to sift through a bed of stones. He picks up a small rough rock and turns it over in his hands. “This one is too coarse,” he says and flicks it back to the pile. Geerlings is after something a little more interesting. Slowly, he walks along the vast sweep of beach, his gaze rarely lifting from the ground. “The sunlight helps to reveal the stones,” he says, bending to pick up and inspect rocks one by one. A little further on, he turns over a small red-brown stone, the colour and texture of a chestnut. “This one could be jasper,” he says, with more enthusiasm. At a distance, the stones look like any others found along New Zealand’s rugged Southland coast, but here, at Orepuki – or Gemstone beach – a closer look reveals a bed of riches. Jasper, hydro-grossular garnet in pinks, greens and yellows, patterned fossilised worm-trails, spotted argillite, frosty white quartz, speckled granites, pink-flecked rhodonite and – in rare cases – the unmistakeable blue of sapphire, colour the low-tide line. The gems likely started their lengthy journey to Gemstone Beach during the last ice age, roughly 16,000-18,000 years ago. As the landscape of Fiordland – the dramatic mountainous region of the lower South Island – altered and released its rocks, the debris was pulled into the flow of the Waiau River and onwards into the sea. The rocks are shaped and polished as they tumble through rivers and tides, until the ocean currents push them back towards land, where finally they embed in the cliffs and blanket the shore. When the tide recedes, the beach is scattered with a geological lolly scramble. And waiting in the wings are rockhounds – dedicated rock fossickers hoping to fill their goody bag. Geerlings, a retired dairy-farmer turned avid rock collector, is one of a number of rockhounds who have scoured this shore for years. Occasionally, he hits the gemstone jackpot. Geerlings dips his hand into the pocket of his overalls and retrieves his prized possession, a buttery yellow rock streaked with bright blue. The lucky find came 10 years ago, after a cliff crumbled into the beach and exposed its treasure. “And then I found this sapphire,” he says, holding it proudly up to the light. Finding a sapphire is rare – Geerlings has found just six in his many years of looking – and there is little one can do to up their chances. “When I found that big one, I was just lucky to be on the beach.” Geerlings is so dedicated to his hobby, he has built a cavernous three bay shed to process and house his impressive collection from around the country. The shelves glitter with stones that swirl like milky galaxies, fossilised wood the colour of brindled fur, and glossy gems like gumdrops. When asked what excites him about collecting rocks, he simply says: “I fell in love with it.” It is a sentiment shared by other enthusiasts. Marion Troon, a member of the Southland geological and lapidary club, caught “gem fever” after a trip to Australia some decades ago. Troon regularly rummages at Gemstone beach and is generous with her tips to new fossickers. Word spreads quickly – more than once, she is interrupted by strangers hoping she can name their finds. The hydro-grossular garnet is the most common of the semi-precious gemstones found here, she says. They are distinguishable not just for their colour, but their texture – rub a quartz through your fingers and it will feel rough; a garnet will feel smooth and almost “greasy”. Looking for stones is a form of “stress relief”, Troon says. “And they have healing qualities.” A long social history An hour east, in Invercargill, Lloyd Esler is sitting on his couch, in a living room that could be mistaken for a natural history museum – the shelves are lined with a lifetime of finds: fossils, bones, books, curios and gems. The historian, educator and author has an insatiable interest in local history – he has published 12 books on the region and has another 7 in the works. Orepuki, or Gemstone beach – has featured in his work. Long before tourists and collectors populated the beach in search of treasure, Māori used the hard garnet stones to polish and sharpen toki, a cutting tool. When Europeans arrived in Orepuki, they discovered gold, and a mining settlement was established. The area also became the site of New Zealand’s only, and short-lived, platinum smelter. With just 47kg extracted from gravels between 1897 and 1907, the smelter soon ceased operations, but its platinum made its way into the 1937 British Imperial State Crown. Though not entirely unique to New Zealand (a few other beaches also yield semi-precious stones), Orepuki is striking, he says. “It has one of the best assortments of unusual pebbles in New Zealand.” “A combination of ocean currents, the shape of the coast and the proximity of the Waiau River – the source of many of the stones – means that the rarities are concentrated along a short strip of beach on account of their weight.” People are permitted to take stones from the beach within reason. No more than a cubic metre is allowed to be taken and they must be gathered by hand, the regional council Environment Southland said. With gems regularly washing ashore, and others released from the cliffs, there is little risk of the gems disappearing, Esler adds. ‘I’m hunting treasure’ It is a bright Monday afternoon in the middle of winter and Gemstone beach is dotted with figures, picking at the shoreline like seabirds. In the distance, the jagged spine of Fiordland curls toward the sea; behind them, farmland stretches inland. Part way down the beach is Trudy Anderson – a local woman whose pockets are slumping under the weight of her morning’s finds. “I’m addicted,” she says. ‘“I am hunting treasure.” Anderson has been travelling to the beach for 30 years and is a frequent visitor but even she is not as diehard as some. “Some people do it religiously every morning”, she says. “People make jewellery out of them, some sell them.” Further up the beach, Mark and Deborah Barber – a couple holidaying from Australia – are giddy over their finds. “The garnet, apparently is the bees knees,” Mark says, holding up a small pale green gem that becomes semi-translucent in the sunlight. “I’m hoping to find my retirement.” That may be a tall order – the gems are unlikely to make you rich, but searching for them can lead to an afternoon of childlike glee. “He’s been trying to drag me out of here for the last hour,” Deborah says. “And I’m saying ‘no – this is my happy place, I want to stay here forever’.”",The Guardian,"Jasper, garnet, sometimes sapphires: pocketfuls of treasure at Gemstone Beach",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/21/jasper-garnet-sometimes-sapphires-pocketfuls-of-treasure-at-gemstone-beach,2024-09-20T20:00:20Z
"In 1964 it was still legal in the UK to refuse service on the basis of someone’s skin colour. Signs saying “No blacks, no Irish, no dogs” were commonplace in pubs and the windows of boarding houses, creating a hostile environment for Black people. The civil rights activist Paul Stephenson, who has died aged 87, played a key role in events that led to the Race Relations Act of 1965 and the outlawing of racial discrimination in Britain. He was the first Black youth worker in Bristol when, in 1963, members of the community decided to challenge the “colour bar” of the Bristol Omnibus Company. The bus company would hire Black and Asian workers only as cleaners, and not in the more lucrative roles of drivers and conductors – a policy backed by the Transport and General Workers’ Union (TGWU) despite a reported labour shortage. Out of the five main organisers of the action – including Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown – Stephenson was the only native Briton, and he used his English accent to good effect. He called the bus company to ask if they had any vacancies, and they, assuming from his voice that he was not one of the dark-skinned immigrants, invited him to send the young man he had recommended for one of the plentiful jobs. When they saw the face of Guy Reid-Bailey, a recent migrant from Jamaica, they promptly informed him that there were no vacancies. The ensuing boycott lasted for four months, and included blocking the buses from moving freely through the city centre. Stephenson was the protesters’ spokesman and won an important legal battle, suing Ron Nethercott, the regional secretary of the TGWU, after Nethercott had called him “irresponsible and dishonest” in the Daily Herald. Stephenson was awarded £500 in damages. The Black community, with support from university students and the local MP, Tony Benn, eventually forced the Bristol Omnibus Company to lift the colour bar. In an overlap with the struggle across the Atlantic, the bus company made the announcement the same day – 28 August – as Martin Luther King delivered his “I have a dream” speech at the March on Washington. Not satisfied with that victory, in 1964 Stephenson staged a one-man sit-in at the Bay Horse pub in Bristol, which was notorious for refusing service to people of colour. Stephenson was initially served by a barman, but when the landlord spotted him, he was told to leave. When he refused, the police were called. Eight officers escorted him from the pub to the police cells for failing to leave a licensed premises. However, following the bus boycott Stephenson was a high-profile figure, and his arrest made national news. He not only beat the charges in court, but later won a defamation case against the pub and the Daily Express. The new Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, sent him a telegram promising to outlaw racial discrimination. Benn, who had been active in the boycott and was close to Stephenson, was a member of the Wilson government that introduced the Race Relations Act in 1965. Paul’s birth in Rochford, Essex, before the outbreak of the second world war, serves as a reminder that there were Black people in England long before the Windrush landed in 1948. His father, from whom he was estranged, was west African, and his mother, Olive Stephenson, of west African and white British descent. At three years old he was evacuated to a children’s home at Great Dunmow, in the Essex countryside. Paul ended up spending seven years at the home, and grew so attached to country living that he wept when he had to leave. He attended Forest Gate secondary school in east London until, aged 16, he joined the RAF as a cadet, serving until 1960. He then did a diploma in sociology and community development at Westhill College, Birmingham, before moving to Bristol in 1962. Following his civil rights actions, Stephenson lost his job in Bristol, but he was in demand for roles created by the Race Relations Act, and was also invited on a tour of the US by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In 1968 he moved to Coventry as a senior community relations officer, then in 1972 joined what became Commission for Racial Equality in London. During this time he met and befriended Muhammad Ali, with whom he founded the Muhammad Ali Sports Development Association to open up sports opportunities for inner-city communities in the UK. In 1975 he was appointed to the Sports Council, where he campaigned against playing sport with apartheid South Africa. Returning to Bristol in 1992, Stephenson played an active role in attempts to get the city to publicly acknowledge its involvement in slavery, and later worked with Unesco over the legacies of the transatlantic slave trade. Stephenson was granted the freedom of the city of Bristol in 2008, made OBE the following year, and given a Pride of Britain award in 2017. He pointedly called his 2011 autobiography Memoirs of a Black Englishman, to remind everyone that he was no foreigner in the country. He met his wife, Joyce (nee Annakie), a psychiatric nurse, in 1965, when he knocked on her door to ask her to sign a petition to improve housing in Bristol, and they married later that year. They had two children, Funmi and Paul Jr, and fostered eight more. In later life he had Parkinson’s and dementia, but his spirit remained undimmed. He died just after the end of the Black History Month themed around “reclaiming narratives”. A common refrain throughout the month is that we need to recover more of the history of Black people in Britain, rather than relying on American figures. A start would be to recognise Stephenson and those of his generation who fought so hard against racism in the UK. Joyce died in 2019. He is survived by his children. • Paul Stephenson, civil rights campaigner and official, born 6 May 1937; died 2 November 2024",The Guardian,Paul Stephenson obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/paul-stephenson-obituary,2024-11-22T20:53:42Z

"French riot police forced their way into a Paris cultural centre at dawn on Tuesday to evict more than 400 young migrants who had occupied the building for three months. Protesters who had gathered outside the Gaîté Lyrique in the central 3rd arrondissement to attempt to stop the raid were forced back by officers using teargas and riot shields. Last month, the city’s chief of police, Laurent Nuñez, gave the occupants, many of whom are reported to be unaccompanied minors, until Tuesday to vacate the premises, stating they had no “right or title” to be there. At 5am on Tuesday about 200 supporters, alerted to an imminent police raid, gathered at the La Gaîté Lyrique, a former theatre turned into a digital arts and modern music venue, an hour before the police and gendarmes arrived. Léa Balage, an MP for Les Écologistes party who was present, said only a few of the occupiers had remained inside the building. “Most of them had left in the night … but they have no [housing] solution,” she told journalists. Another MP present, Danielle Simonnet, a member of the Parti de Gauche (Left party) and La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) said the prefecture had proposed to house the squatters in Rouen, 80 miles (130km) north-west of Paris. Many of the evicted people refused to board buses destined to take them out of the city and several joined the protesters outside. Witnesses said only a handful had agreed to be relocated. “It’s far from satisfactory for them- above all for those who have hearings in Paris and who are being schooled here,” Simonnet said. After the building was cleared, the situation remained tense with protesters involved in clashes with police for several hours. By Tuesday afternoon, police vans were still blocking both ends of the pedestrian street to ensure nobody returned while the centre was secured and the damage inside assessed. The seven-story building whose facade dates back to 1862, opened in 2011 after a three-and-a-half year renovation. It has three performance venues, exhibition spaces, a resource centre that serves as a library and where workshops and educational courses re held, a video gaming area, artist exhibition spaces, and a shop. The centre cancelled its artistic programme in December and accused the city authorities and government of inaction. The occupation had become a political football between the city and state authorities over who was responsible. On Tuesday, David Robert, a spokesperson for the Gaîté Lyrique, said: “As a citizen I can’t be happy that it appears most of the youngsters will sleep in the street this evening.” “We suffered this occupation but as a cultural and social organisation it was not our responsibility to put people in the street in the middle of winter amid subzero temperatures. “We asked for an evacuation along with dignified conditions for these people which seemed essential,” Robert told BFMTV.",The Guardian,Police evict more than 400 young people occupying Paris cultural centre,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/police-evict-over-400-young-people-occupying-paris-cultural-centre,2025-03-18T16:49:30Z

"Transgender people in New South Wales could soon be able to change their sex on their birth certificates without getting surgery, but gay teachers will still be able to be fired from some schools after a watered-down proposal received the premier’s support. The premier, Chris Minns, will this week ask the Labor caucus to back independent MP Alex Greenwich’s equality bill after a raft of amendments were made, including dropping changes to the Anti-Discrimination Act governing schools. It is expected the legislation will be passed in the next two weeks. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “It would be a really powerful affirmation and show of support from the government to the trans community,” Greenwich said. “It would be empowering the trans community in NSW to have identity that truly reflects who they are.” The Sydney MP, who introduced the proposed legislation a year ago, said it was “heartbreaking” to lose some parts of the proposed reforms. He said he hopes to pursue changes to laws governing the treatment of gay students and teachers after the NSW Law Reform Commission’s review into the Anti-Discrimination Act is handed down. “I am seeking to achieve the reforms that I can get support for now, to improve the safety and lives of LGBTQ people and continuing on all of the other items,” Greenwich said. “It’s not over.” The reforms include protections for intersex children from unnecessary medical interventions and the creation of a domestic violence offence for outing or threatening to out an LGBTQI partner. Equality Australia’s chief executive, Anna Brown, said NSW had a chance to change its “archaic, cruel and discriminatory laws”. “Although it’s deeply disappointing some reforms have been removed from the equality bill, it still contains vital measures that will improve the lives of people across NSW,” she said. Minns said it was time for the parliament to deal with the legislation that he wanted to see passed. He said the changes to the birth certificate regulations would bring NSW into line with other states and mean people were not “forced” into major surgeries. “If people want to make that decision, that’s fine, but I do not think the state should be pursuing policies that force people into doing it,” Minns said.

"Leaders and environmental advocates in the Pacific have expressed alarm over Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and freeze foreign aid, warning the moves will accelerate the existential threats they face as nations on the frontlines of the climate crisis. The Paris agreement is the world’s main effort to address the impacts of the climate crisis. Trump has called it “unfair” and a “rip off”. In an interview with the Guardian, Samoa’s prime minister Fiame Naomi Mataʻafa described Trump’s move to pull out of the Paris agreement as “very disappointing,” saying it would undermine global climate action and put the survival of Pacific countries at greater risk. “We look to the US as a global leader, but they seem to not recognise this global issue, not only for Samoa but for the Pacific,” Fiame said. “It’s not surprising … nevertheless, it is very disappointing,” the prime minister said. A freeze on US foreign aid has deepened concerns that the Pacific region will suffer further as crucial assistance for climate adaptation, disaster management, extreme weather resilience is cut, or under threat. In addition, Fiame told the Guardian Pacific countries would be “seriously impacted” by the withdrawal from the World Health Organisation and other multilateral bodies. “These are the forums that small countries rely on; they are critical to our voices being heard and our causes being addressed,” she said. Under the Biden administration, Washington increased its engagement with Pacific island nations, emphasising climate change as a central concern. In 2022, then-vice president Kamala Harris announced a substantial aid boost, pledging to triple US assistance to the region to $600m. Despite their minimal contribution, Pacific nations face severe and disproportionate climate impacts including rising sea levels, coastal erosion, loss of freshwater sources, and potential displacement. Additionally, extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, floods, and droughts continue to devastate infrastructure, homes, and economies across the region. The Paris agreement is the first legally binding climate treaty to explicitly recognise loss and damage as a separate pillar of climate action, distinct from mitigation and adaptation. This marked a significant victory for Pacific island countries, which had long pushed for its recognition in global climate negotiations. Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, James Marape, told PNG media that the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement was “morally wrong.” “The United States has recently revitalised its relations with the Pacific, and it is very discouraging to see it backing down from climate talks, which have a direct impact on climate change mitigation for us in the Pacific,” Marape said. “We continue to be subjected to rising sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns that impact lives and economies.” From fiscal years 2017 through 2023, US agencies provided more than $420.3m to address climate risks in 14 Pacific Island countries and three US territories in the Pacific, according to the US government accountability office. US-funded projects include climate resilience initiatives and livelihood protection in Papua New Guinea’s rural highland communities, and the development of early warning systems for remote communities in Fiji. Samoa-based Sefanaia Nawadra is director-general of the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), an organisation that works with Pacific governments on environmental protection. He described the US climate policy shifts as “disheartening” and said the Pacific must now “work harder and smarter, together and with all available partners to meet the needs of our people.” “Climate change represents the single greatest threat to our region,” he said. However, SPREP notes that other partners may step in to fill funding gaps left by the US. Pacific nations receive climate funding and support from a range of other governments – including Australia, the UK, China and Japan – and also access financial support from multilateral organisations. Nawadra said Pacific countries “will continue to seek and receive support from existing partnerships” to address their adaptation and mitigation needs. Pacific climate campaigner Jacynta Faʻamau of 350.org said the climate crisis was “the greatest security threat to the Pacific,” while emphasising the region’s resilience. “Island nations are committing to scaling up their own renewable energy plans and doing their part to secure our futures. “The government of the US and the rest of the global north have a lot to answer for in terms of historical responsibility for the climate crisis, but they are no longer who we are looking to for leadership,” she said.",The Guardian,Leaders in the Pacific raise alarm over ‘direct impact’ of Trump’s climate retreat and aid freeze,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/leaders-in-the-pacific-raise-alarm-over-direct-impact-of-trumps-climate-retreat-and-aid-freeze,2025-02-01T00:00:27Z
